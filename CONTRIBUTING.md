# Contributing to R-Shell

First off, thank you for considering contributing to R-Shell! 🎉

## 🎯 Project Context

This is a **learning and practice project for vibing coding** methodology. The frontend is AI-generated from Figma designs, and development is powered by GitHub Copilot. We welcome contributions that align with this experimental approach!

### 🐛 Reporting Bugs

Search [existing issues](https://github.com/GOODBOY008/r-shell/issues?q=is%3Aissue), then choose **Bug report** in the [issue chooser](https://github.com/GOODBOY008/r-shell/issues/new/choose). Include your R-Shell version, local OS, steps to reproduce, and what you expected to happen. If the issue involves a remote connection, include the protocol and any relevant server details. Remove credentials and sensitive host details from logs and screenshots.

### 💡 Suggesting Enhancements

Use [Ideas](https://github.com/GOODBOY008/r-shell/discussions/categories/ideas) to explore a proposal with the community. For a specific change you want the project to track, choose **Feature request** in the [issue chooser](https://github.com/GOODBOY008/r-shell/issues/new/choose) and describe your use case and proposed behavior.

### 🔧 Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. Ensure the test suite passes
4. Make sure your code follows the existing style
5. Write a clear commit message

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- pnpm
- Rust (latest stable)
- Tauri CLI dependencies

### Installation

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/your-username/r-shell.git
cd r-shell

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run frontend tests
pnpm test

# Run Rust tests
cd src-tauri
cargo test

# Run E2E tests (configure credentials first)
pnpm playwright test
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** - Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. **Follow commit conventions** - Use conventional commits format:
   - `feat:` - New features
   - `fix:` - Bug fixes
   - `docs:` - Documentation changes
   - `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, etc)
   - `refactor:` - Code refactoring
   - `test:` - Adding or updating tests
   - `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

3. **Update tests** - Add or update tests as needed
4. **Keep commits focused** - One logical change per commit
5. **Write clear PR descriptions** - Explain what and why

### Example Commit Messages

```
feat: add SSH key authentication support
fix: resolve memory leak in terminal component
docs: update installation instructions for Windows
refactor: simplify connection profile management
```

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript/React

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing code formatting (Prettier)
- Use functional components and hooks
- Keep components focused and single-purpose
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### Rust

- Follow Rust standard style guidelines (rustfmt)
- Use `cargo clippy` to catch common mistakes
- Add documentation comments for public APIs
- Handle errors properly (don't unwrap in production code)

### General

- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add comments for complex logic
- Update documentation when changing behavior
