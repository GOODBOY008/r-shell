### 3. **rename_file**
- Renames or moves files/directories
- Uses `mv` command
- **Parameters**: `session_id`, `old_path`, `new_path`

### 4. **create_file**
- Creates new files with content
- Uses SFTP upload_file_from_bytes
- **Parameters**: `session_id`, `path`, `content`

### 5. **read_file_content**
- Reads file content from remote server
- Uses `cat` command
- **Parameters**: `session_id`, `path`

### 6. **copy_file**
- Copies files or directories
- Uses `cp -r` for recursive copying
- **Parameters**: `session_id`, `source_path`, `dest_path`

## Frontend Features Implemented

- ✅ **Copy files**: Clipboard with real copy operation
- ✅ **Cut/Move files**: Clipboard with real move operation
- ✅ **Duplicate files**: Copy with `_copy` suffix
- ✅ **File info**: Size, permissions, ownership display

### File Transfer
- ✅ **Upload files**: Click upload button, select files
- ✅ **Download files**: Context menu or double-click
- ✅ **Drag & drop upload**: Drop files into file browser
- ✅ **Transfer progress**: Shows real-time upload/download status
- ✅ **Multiple file transfers**: Queue management

### File Editing
- ✅ **View file content**: Double-click text files to view
- ✅ **Edit file content**: Modify content in dialog
- ✅ **Save changes**: Real save via SFTP

### UI Features
- ✅ **Search/filter**: Real-time file filtering
- ✅ **File selection**: Multi-select with checkboxes
- ✅ **Context menu**: Right-click for file operations
- ✅ **Keyboard shortcuts**:
  - `Ctrl+C`: Copy selected files
  - `Ctrl+X`: Cut selected files
  - `Ctrl+V`: Paste files
  - `Ctrl+A`: Select all files
  - `Ctrl+R`: Refresh file list
  - `Delete`: Delete selected files
  - `F2`: Rename selected file
  - `Escape`: Clear selection/cancel rename

### File Browser UI
- Column-based layout with:
  - Name (with icons)
  - Size (formatted)
  - Modified date
  - Permissions
  - Owner/Group
- Resizable columns
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Home button
- Refresh button
- Transfer status indicator

## Integration Points

### Session Management
- All operations use the session_id from active SSH connection
- Concurrent operations supported via Arc<Handle> session sharing
- No blocking between file operations and terminal commands

### Error Handling
- Try-catch blocks for all async operations
- Toast notifications for success/error messages
- User-friendly error messages

## File Path Handling
All file paths properly handle:
- Root directory (`/`)
- Nested directories (`/home/user/documents`)
- Special characters in filenames (via shell escaping in commands)

## Transfer Management
- Transfer queue with status tracking:
  - `queued`: Waiting to start
  - `transferring`: In progress
  - `completed`: Successfully transferred
  - `error`: Failed with error
- Real-time progress updates
- Speed calculation (bytes/sec)
- Expandable transfer panel

## Security Considerations
- All file operations use the authenticated SSH session
- File paths are properly escaped in shell commands
- Permissions are preserved during operations
- No local file system access (all via SSH)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Connect to SSH server
2. Navigate to different directories
3. Create folders and files
4. Upload files via button and drag-drop
5. Download files
6. Edit text files
7. Copy/cut/paste operations
8. Rename files
9. Delete files
10. Test keyboard shortcuts
11. Test multi-select operations

## Future Enhancements
- [ ] File permission editing (chmod)
- [ ] Symbolic link creation
- [ ] Archive operations (zip/unzip)
- [ ] File comparison/diff
- [ ] Thumbnail previews for images
- [ ] Syntax highlighting in file editor
- [ ] Large file chunked upload with real progress
- [ ] Resume interrupted transfers
- [ ] Batch operations UI
- [ ] Favorites/bookmarks for directories
- [ ] File search across directories
